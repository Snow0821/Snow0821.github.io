# Curriculum Progress Tracker

This file records the high-level status of the self-directed curriculum so that any machine (and Codex) can immediately recover context.

## Current Snapshot

| Field | Focus | Status | Next Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mathematics | Foundational analysis and structures for all sciences | Not Started | Identify textbooks and seed subject overviews |
| Computer Science | Formal computation, architecture, and systems | Not Started | Identify textbooks and seed subject overviews |
| Physics | Modeling nature with mathematical rigor | Not Started | Identify textbooks and seed subject overviews |
| Chemistry | Structure, bonding, and molecular transformation | Not Started | Identify textbooks and seed subject overviews |
| Biology | Information flow and complex living systems | Not Started | Identify textbooks and seed subject overviews |

## Update Instructions
- Update the table whenever a field meaningfully progresses (new textbook chosen, major section completed, etc.).
- Reference the per-field `progress.md` files for detailed notes and Codex cues.
- Record blockers or questions for Codex under **Next Action** so future sessions resume smoothly.
