# My Curriculum

This document defines the purpose, scope, and management rules for a self-directed undergraduate-level curriculum.

This file is the single authoritative reference for:
- What this project studies
- How it is structured
- How it may be extended over time

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this project is to systematically study the core foundations
of major scientific disciplines at a level equivalent to a standard undergraduate education at a strong university.

The focus is on:
- Conceptual understanding
- Structural and mathematical reasoning
- Long-term reusability of knowledge

## 2. Fields of Study

This curriculum covers the following five fields:

- Mathematics
- Computer Science
- Physics
- Chemistry
- Biology

## 3. Textbook Selection Criteria

Textbooks used in this curriculum should satisfy the following criteria.

### 3.1 Academic Standard

A textbook is preferred if it is:
- Widely used in undergraduate courses at strong universities
- Recognized as a standard or canonical reference in the field

### 3.2 Accessibility

Due to practical constraints, strong preference is given to textbooks that:
- Provide an official, freely available PDF
- Are published as open textbooks or lecture notes

Paid textbooks may be referenced conceptually,
but open-access alternatives should be prioritized whenever possible.

## 4. Core Curriculum

This section defines the actual educational content of the curriculum.

Each field is divided into core subfields that are commonly covered in undergraduate programs. These subfields represent the minimum expected scope of study.

They may be refined or subdivided as the project evolves.

### 4.1 Mathematics

Core subfields:
- Calculus
- Linear Algebra
- Real Analysis
- Probability Theory
- Differential Equations

Notes:
- Emphasis on mathematical structure and rigor
- Serves as the foundation for all other fields

### 4.2 Computer Science

Core subfields:
- Programming Fundamentals
- Data Structures
- Algorithms
- Computer Architecture
- Operating Systems
- Theory of Computation

Notes:
- Focus on formal models of computation
- Avoids framework- or tool-specific knowledge

### 4.3 Physics

Core subfields:
- Classical Mechanics
- Electromagnetism
- Waves and Oscillations
- Quantum Mechanics
- Thermodynamics and Statistical Physics

Notes:
- Strong coupling with mathematics
- Emphasis on model-building and physical interpretation

### 4.4 Chemistry

Core subfields:
- General Chemistry
- Physical Chemistry
- Organic Chemistry
- Analytical Chemistry

Notes:
- Focus on molecular structure and transformation
- Physical chemistry acts as a bridge to physics

### 4.5 Biology

Core subfields:
- Cell Biology
- Molecular Biology
- Genetics
- Biochemistry
- Evolutionary Biology

Notes:
- Focus on information flow and biological systems
- Emphasis on molecular-level understanding

## 5. Rules for Refinement and Expansion

Subfields may be refined or subdivided over time.

Any refinement should satisfy the following:
1. It clearly belongs to an existing field
2. It corresponds to undergraduate-level material
3. It is motivated by standard textbooks or university curricula

All major refinements should be reflected in this document.

## 6. Role of This Document

This document does not contain detailed notes or exercises.

Instead, it serves as:
- A conceptual map of the curriculum
- A management and control point
- A reference for automated assistance (e.g., Codex)

Detailed materials may be organized elsewhere,
but this file defines the authoritative structure.
